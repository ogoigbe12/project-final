                    <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2> 
                    <p>Victoria Boston was raised by parents who believed in education and follow-through. “Mom was an educator who knew the importance of reading and learning, and Dad was a military man who knew the importance of finishing what you start,” she says. She noted that her parents were disappointed when she decided to work full time for the Navy rather than go on to 
                        college after high school, and it became important to her to find a way to eventually get a degree.</p><br>
                    <p>If you asked Carl Jackson what he’s most thankful for, he’ll tell you two things: his community, and his education. A Strayer alumnus and candidate for Maryland’s 8th District Delegate seat, Carl knows firsthand the value of a good degree. He says his experience at Strayer helped paved the way to his success, and even helped create the springboard for his run for office.  Now, he’s focused on giving back to his community by bringing his talents and skills to the political stage, where he hopes to be a 
                        force for positive change. He has many ideas of what to fix and how—but he wasn’t always this ambitious. It was his education and life experiences that shaped him into what he is today.</p><br>
                        <p>Sareeta was community minded from an early age.  While her parents didn’t have college degrees or a lot of money, they did provide Sareeta exposure to people, events, panels, and other community 
                            engagements throughout her youth. Following in her parents’ footsteps, she quickly became an active voice in the community and eventually, a local student leader.</p><br>
                        <p>After several years in an entry-level human resources role, Teaa Allston-Bing was certain that HR was her passion. She also knew that without the right education credentials, she was limited in how high she could climb on the HR ladder. While juggling a full-time job at a government agency and the responsibilities of being a single mother, Allston-Bing earned an Associate in Arts – Business Administration at Strayer University. Following earning an Associate’s degree, her employer promoted her to human resource administrator.

                            She could’ve stopped there. But she didn’t.</p>
