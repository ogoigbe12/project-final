                        <p>Besides the stunning recommendation from a close Nigerian friend about her experience at NTU, I was drawn by the amazing offers that were available beyond the course. I had no doubt when selecting Nottingham Trent University for my postgraduate degree because of the holistic experience I had during my undergraduate degree. My main requirements were focused on the MBA course content, the accreditation, the employability rate, and the financial aspect.</p>

                        <p>I am currently studying MSc Project Management which provides me with the opportunity to work with diverse teams and get hands on knowledge of how to manage projects. The course equips me with the current project management practices and how to deliver projects on time, within budget and to the agreed specification irrespective of the constraints of time, cost, and resources.  Furthermore, equipped with a knowledge on how to manage these constraints I was able to work on a plethora of projects in my current Placement with the International Development Office of the University, where I have effectively managed my time and deliver on tasks in various projects which were running simultaneously.</p>
